## OIV features
1. Handle HUGE files (try to load an 80MP image and you will understand what we are taking about)
2. Instantly switch between images
3. Image manipulation methods for adjusting brightness, contrast, saturation, hue, gamma, exposure

## TODO
### UX
1. semi-transparent widgets that display additional information such as thumbnails, metadata or histogram
2. Support the ability to browse images in zip or MS Office files which can be extracted to a directory
3. Metadata stored with the image can be displayed and you can add notes to images.
4. Tthumbnail preview of the current folder
5. File explorer panel which allows switching between folders
6. Within a directory, apply a file filter, so that only images are displayed whose filenames have a certain string or match a regular expression
7. Pseudo color function which allows creating false color images
8. Synchronization of multiple instances. With this feature you can easily compare images by zooming and/or panning at the exactly same position or even by overlaying them with different opacities.
